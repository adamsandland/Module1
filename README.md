## Overview

**Project Title**: Procedural Generation

**Project Description**: Making a map using procedural generation, kind of like minecraft.

**Project Goals**: Design procedural generation, use classes for different tiles, and try to display the procedurally generated map.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure java is installed
2. run "javac ProceduralMapRenderer.java && java ProceduralMa
pRenderer" in a terminal in the directory here the program is located.

Instructions for using the software:

1. This software is simple. It does not require any interaction, but if you'd like, you can change the rows and columns on lines 91 & 92 to make a differently sized map.
2. Note: all maps are randomly generated using a simple white noise generator. Try running multiple times to see what you get!

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* java
* javax
